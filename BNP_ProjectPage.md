**Project description:** During the 4th semester of my Bachelor’s degree, I collaborated with a team of four to develop a mobile social game for Android. The game divides the real world into a 1.5m by 1.5m grid, allowing players to virtually "mark their territory" in the real world by walking around, drawing inspiration from Reddit’s _r/place_ social experiment.

### Goals

The primary objective was to design and implement a context-aware mobile social game, with context defined in terms of:

- Mobile factors such as location, weather, and time
- Social elements like networks, user preferences, or current interaction situations

### Short Description of the Game

The game’s idea revolves around players marking areas in the real world, competing or collaborating with others to gain control of more territory.

- **Collaboration:** Players can team up to create large, colourful murals by marking adjacent squares together.
- **Competition:** Players can "steal" territories from others, fostering rivalry.
- **Wolfpacks:** Players can form social groups to collectively claim larger territories.
- **Turf Wars:** Players can engage in direct challenges to compete for dominance within a defined boundary by a specific deadline.

### Technical Aspects

- **Platform:** Android
- **Engine:** Android Studio with Java and Gradle Build Environment
- **Tools Used:**
  - **Firebase:** For storing user information and global game state, including which grid squares belong to which players.
  - **Google Maps API:** For real-time location tracking during gameplay.
  - **Google Plus Codes:** To divide the world into 1.5m by 1.5m grid squares using short location codes based on latitude and longitude.

### My Contribution

I was responsible for:
- Implementing real-time location functionality using the Google Maps API
- Developing the method to divide the real world into a grid using Google Plus Codes
- Creating the feature that allows players to mark areas virtually, including the ability to leave messages for other players on their marked territories
